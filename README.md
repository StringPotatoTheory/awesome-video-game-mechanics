# Video Game Mechanics Wiki

There's a lot of websites with information like "Games like X" but what if you really like a specific mechanic? Maybe one that's not covered well with tags on Steam?

Have a look under `/content/` or [the website](https://stringpotatotheory.github.io/awesome-video-game-mechanics/) to start your search!

Feel free to add games to these lists (or make your own video game mechanics lists!) by [contributing to this repo](CONTRIBUTING.md).
