Prime examples of this are the time rewind mechanics in Life is Strange, and Braid.

Note this is different than the entire game being a [time loop](@/time-loop.md).

- Life is Strange
- Braid

## Smaller mechanic in the game

- Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - You can rewind certain objects in the world so they move, but you aren't rewinding yourself or anything else outside of that object.
