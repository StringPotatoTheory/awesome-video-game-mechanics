There's a lot of websites with information like "Games like X" but what if you really like a specific mechanic? Either have a look at the Games tab, use the search bar, or view the homepage to start your search!

Feel free to add games to these lists (or make your own video game mechanics lists!) by [contributing to the repo](https://github.com/StringPotatoTheory/awesome-video-game-mechanics/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) on GitHub. Either [create an issue](https://github.com/StringPotatoTheory/awesome-video-game-mechanics/issues) with your mechanic and games, or fork and create a pull request with your additions.
